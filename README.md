## JavaScript implementation to Ruby
####(Hackership project)

### Goal: To learn how programming languages work by implementing JS to Ruby using Rubinius as a base tool & to write a tutorial for beginners.
<br>

My goal from the very beginning was to understand programming languages deeper by mastering Ruby itself, without using any frameworks. The initial project idea was to create my own language from scratch, but I realised that even though the technical part of the task (parser, compiler) is hard, it can be done with my full focus and help from more experienced programmers. The real struggle without a solution would be to design a new language, especially since I know only Ruby and don’t know much (yet) about other languages and its concepts. That’s why I decided to slightly change the plan. Here are the benefits of it:

-  to achieve the goal, I have to be comfortable with JS and it’s syntax, which is a language I know only a little, but is the language that all programmers need to be familiar with;
-  I will still need to learn all the theory behind how actually programming languages are executed. This will lead me to writing my own parser & compiler and will help to understand data structure, bytecode, binaries and many other things related to programming itself;
-  Rubinius will be my base tool, what means that I will be using Ruby as a language to create all the files. Writing this kind of code is definitely a completely different experience than creating web applications and will help me to write better code.
-  writing tutorial through all the steps and blog posts with theory that might be helpful for other people like me, who are still beginning with programming and want to learn more, but find it difficult to find source of knowledge that fits their level. By writing this down I would also learn myself more and got the knowledge more structured.

1. 1st week:
  1. JavaScript learning through online tutorials
  2. getting to know the theory of how the process of implementing a language looks like
  and understanding core concepts
    - I will be comfortable with JS code and familiar with its syntax
    - The big picture of the process will give me a base to go deeper
2. 2nd week:
  1. writing a parser that transforms JS code to AST tree based on only addition operation
  (eg: “2+3;”)
  2. more knowledge by practice about parsers, parsing itself and data structure
    - The basic parser will be ready
    - I will understand how programming methods are being called and structured
3. 3rd week:
  1. writing a compiler that transforms AST tree to byte code
  1. stack vs register based model theory
    - The basic compiler will be ready
    -  I will have understanding of breaking the code into little parts and how does it have to be structured to be executed.
4. 4th week:
  1. theory behind Virtual Machine that executes code
  2. splitting bytecode into binary code
  - Knowledge about smallest parts of code that it can be split to (binaries)
  - Understanding how all programming   languages have the same base
5. 6th - 9th week:
  1. working on more complex JS math and string operations
  2. local variables, objects, functions and closures
  -  Getting to this point, even if it will not be fully functional JS implementation, will be a great learning success.
  - Finishing up the tutorial
